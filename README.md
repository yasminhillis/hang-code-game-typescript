# ⚙️ HangCode

A creative twist on the classic **Hangman** — but with a developer’s flavor!  
Guess the hidden word, and with each wrong guess, a **programming language** gets eliminated.  
Keep your logic sharp, because once all languages are gone… only **Assembly** remains.

---

## 🕹️ How It Works

1. A random word is selected for you to guess.
2. Each incorrect guess eliminates one programming language from the list.
3. The game ends when:
   - You correctly guess the word 🎉  
   - Or all languages are gone, leaving only Assembly 💀

## 💡 Example

Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

Word: _ _ _ _ _

❌ Wrong guess: “E” → HTML eliminated

❌ Wrong guess: “A” → CSS eliminated

✅ Correct guess: “O”


Can you save the stack before everything compiles down to Assembly?
